<p class="leader">My own love and respect for our natural world started at a young age. My dad had always been a nature lover and hunter since he was a teenager. When I was a kid he'd take me hiking deep into the woods and I instantly fell in love. As I got older, this love of nature, moreso, the forest only grew. I myself learned to respect the land as I became a hunter just like my dad. Though I do not hunt anymore due to a physical disability, I love finding excessable trails that I can find myself in the midst of the forest again.</p>
