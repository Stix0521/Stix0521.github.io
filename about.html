<p class="leader">About
  
Trees! No, not just trees, but rather their importance to our ecosystems, the ozone layer,
turning carbon dioxide into oxygen, and literally being the lungs of our planet. I feel very strongly
about protecting our environment, and with forest fires, destruction of forests for farming, and
industry, we are damaging our planet beyond the brink. Furthermore, there are a growing
number of organizations planting trees and protecting forests, with more information being
released each day about how someone can help.
  
I want people to feel angry, emotional--I want them to be empathetic, but most of all, I
want people to act. We have one planet to live on and we are blatantly destroying it on a daily
basis. I feel my message will reach a younger audience as they are the ones really taking
action. Many of the older generations (no offense!) do not believe in environmental issues, and
many do not care unless it is their chosen career path. Anyone can take action, but most do not,
and I wish to help spread awareness of what you can do. It will literally cost nothing.
  
I wish to get the perspective of the experts in the field of environmental protection, and
conservation. I will also gather information from the leading organizations of what they are
doing, and the statistics they have gathered. Two individuals I would like to compile information
from are Jane Goodall, and David Atternborough. They are an inspiration to me and Iâ€™ve read
many of their books.
  
A blend of text, links to organizations, and pictures. The text to explain our dreadful
situations and what will happen if we do nothing to protect our planet. Links so people can get
involved. I think pictures are a huge driving point so people can see exactly what damages we
  our imposing on our planet. Some irreversible.</p>
