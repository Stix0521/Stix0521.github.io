<p class="leader">Our planet is dying, and humankind is the reason behind it. Our forests are at stake; between forest fires, clearing forests for farming--and development, we are in turn destroying our planet, and the lungs of the Earth. In Africa, many trees are being cleared for inadaquet farming; meaning, the land they are clearing is not furtile for farming. This is mostly mountainous and hilly areas. In turn, they have also destroyed once furtile land by over farming, but another factor is of course global warming. The land is dry and desolate and nothing grows. To get fire wood for cooking, the woman of the household is literally lacking at dried stumps to get the wood they need. There is a way to fix this, though.</p>
